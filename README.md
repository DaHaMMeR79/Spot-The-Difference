# Spot-The-Difference
A Game created using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript

This game uses code I made for another Spot The Difference game which I made for a Class, in which students worked together to create
an Escape Room style Web Experience.
Other than the code for the game mechanics, I've replaced the Images for other Images and added an answer sheet feature.
